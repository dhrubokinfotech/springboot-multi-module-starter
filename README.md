### Clone Repository

```

### Build & Run
There are several ways to build and run a Spring Boot application. After cloning this repository, you can build it using the below command:

```
mvn clean install
```

Before giving this command, make sure that Maven is already installed on your PC. This command will clear the target folder and previously generated JAR files, build an artifact, and then create a new JAR file,Â  <span style = "color: cyan">starter-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</span> inside the target directory. Now, you can run this JAR file using the below command:

```
java -jar starter-core\target\starter-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Also, you can directly run this application without an explicit build using the below command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or, you can run this application via the <span style = "color: cyan">Run</span> button of your preferred IDE.

You can get the REST APIs with documentation here: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html.
