### Clone Repository
Clone this repository from https://github.com/dhrubokinfotech/springboot-multi-module-starter.git or use the below command for the GitHub CLI:

```
gh repo clone dhrubokinfotech/springboot-multi-module-starter
```

### Build & Run
There are several ways to build and run a Spring Boot application. After cloning this repository, you can build it using the below command:

```
mvn clean install
```

Before giving this command, make sure that Maven is already installed on your PC. This command will clear the target folder and previously generated JAR files, build an artifact, and then create a new JAR file,Â  <span style = "color: cyan">starter-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</span> inside the target directory. Now, you can run this JAR file using the below command:

```
java -jar starter-core\target\starter-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Also, you can directly run this application without an explicit build using the below command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or, you can run this application via the <span style = "color: cyan">Run</span> button of your preferred IDE.

You can get the REST APIs with documentation here: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html.

### User Manual
- [ ] Step - 1 : Rename the project as all as the project directory.
- [ ] Step - 2 : Add a new module. Suppose you've added a module with GroupId: <span style = "color: cyan">com.disl</span> and ArtifactId: <span style = "color: cyan">contact-management</span>. A new module will be added with a pom.xml file.
- [ ] Step - 3 : Add the following dependency in the pom.xml file of your new module - 

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.disl</groupId>
    <artifactId>starter-commons</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

It means that, your new module now can use the <span style = "color: cyan">starter-commons</span> module. There are all the common properties and configurations in <span style = "color: cyan">starter-commons</span> module.
- [ ] Step - 4 : Now you can implement a feature - add models, repositories, services in your new module.
- [ ] Step - 4 : The Controller classes of your new module should be in _**com.disl.startercore.feature**_ package under the <span style = "color: cyan">starter-core</span> module. While creating Controllers of your new module in <span style = "color: cyan">starter-core</span> module, your need to inject the Service classes of your new module. So, add the following dependency in the pom.xml file of <span style = "color: cyan">starter-core</span> module -

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.disl</groupId>
    <artifactId>contact-management</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

- [ ] Step - 5 : Write the Controller classes of your new module and run your application.

Thank You.
